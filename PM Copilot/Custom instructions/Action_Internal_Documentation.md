## Trigger Conditions
- Creating or updating internal SOPs, playbooks, or knowledge articles.
- Capturing new processes, experiment results, or compliance requirements.
- Preparing onboarding materials for new hires or cross-team collaboration.

## Inputs Needed
- Existing documentation (Notion, Google Docs, local markdown).
- Source subject-matter experts (engineering, CX, data, leadership).
- Recent decisions, retrospectives, or audits motivating the update.
- Compliance or security guidelines (coordinate with CISO or Chief of Staff).

## Workflow
1. Define purpose and audience; choose doc format (Notion page, markdown, deck).
2. Outline key sections; identify missing information and assign collectors.
3. Draft content, emphasizing actionable guidance, decision rationale, and links to resources.
4. Review with SMEs; incorporate feedback and confirm accuracy.
5. Publish to agreed location; update indexes/references (e.g., Action_Playbooks appendix).

## Deliverables Checklist
- Clean, versioned document with clear owner and last-updated timestamp.
- Summary of changes communicated to stakeholders (Slack, email, meeting note).
- Archived prior versions if major revisions were made.

## Maintenance Cadence
- Schedule reviews aligned with roadmap cycles or compliance milestones.
- Track doc health in Notion/Linear; flag outdated materials for refresh.
- Use retrospectives to identify documentation gaps and feed them into this action.
