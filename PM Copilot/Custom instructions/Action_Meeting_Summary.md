## Trigger Conditions
- Post-meeting or interview requires a concise synthesis for stakeholders or follow-up.
- Need to translate raw notes into actionable next steps and decisions.
- Preparing archival summary for initiative history or hand-offs.

## Inputs Needed
- Raw meeting notes (transcript stored in `@Meetings`, personal notes, chat logs).
- Attendee list and roles.
- Meeting objectives or agenda.
- Related docs referenced during the session.

## Workflow
1. Confirm meeting purpose and capture headline outcome.
2. Extract key decisions, blockers, and owner assignments.
3. Summarize insights or quotes relevant to product strategy, delivery, or customer impact.
4. Highlight unanswered questions or follow-up tasks.
5. Store summary in appropriate folder (`@Initiative level context` or relevant project space) and share with stakeholders.

## Deliverables Checklist
- Summary document with sections: `Purpose`, `Highlights`, `Decisions`, `Action Items`, `Open Questions`.
- Action item list with owners and due dates mirrored in Linear/project tracker as needed.
- Distribution note (Slack/email) confirming stakeholders have the summary.

## Best Practices
- Keep summary < 300 words when possible; use bullets for readability.
- Emphasize implications to ARR, reliability, delivery speed, or PMF.
- Flag if any stakeholder feedback is pending before finalizing.
