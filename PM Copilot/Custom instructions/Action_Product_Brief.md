## Trigger Conditions
- New product opportunity or feature requires clarification prior to engineering.
- Discovery surfaced assumptions that need validation or formal alignment.
- An initiative is entering build stage and needs source-of-truth documentation.

## Inputs Needed
- Problem statement and customer/job context.
- Relevant data points (product metrics, customer interviews, market research).
- Stakeholder list (engineering, CX, data, sales) and known dependencies.
- Links to prior docs (initiative briefs, retro notes, experiment results).

## Step-by-Step Flow
1. **Define the foundation (PMF-first)**
   - **Overview**: Name the business/industry process or action this addresses with concise description.
   - **Customer Pain**: Articulate the specific pain points, frustrations, or unmet needs.
   - **Product Vision**: Describe the end result—what the world looks like when this pain is solved.
   - **How It Works**: Detail the customer experience—what they see, do, and feel when using the solution.
2. **Validate PMF signals**
   - **Success Metrics**: Define how we'll measure PMF improvement (adoption, retention, revenue impact, satisfaction).
   - **Why Now?**: Capture urgency, market timing, or regulatory/competitive context that makes this the right moment.
3. **Assess feasibility**
   - **Technical Considerations**: Outline feasibility for engineering handoff (data sources, integrations, technical risks).
   - **Open Questions & Risks**: List unknowns that could block PMF or delivery, prioritize validation needs.
4. **Align stakeholders**
   - Review draft with engineering lead for technical feasibility and edge cases.
   - Review with CEO/leadership for business and strategic alignment.
   - Sync with CX lead for user workflow validation.
   - Sync with data team for instrumentation and success metrics.
5. **Finalize Product Brief**
   - Distill into clear narrative; add acceptance criteria and detailed requirements as needed.
   - Store Product Brief under relevant initiative folder; tag action owners and due dates.

## Deliverables Checklist
- Product Brief document with PMF-first structure: Overview, Customer Pain, Product Vision, How It Works.
- Success metrics tied to strategic pillars (ARR, reliability, delivery speed, PMF).
- Technical considerations and open questions documented.
- Decision log summarizing stakeholder inputs and outstanding follow-ups.

## Hand-off & Follow-up
- Share Product Brief in dev review with engineering lead and ensure tasks are entered in Linear or project tracker.
- Schedule UAT readiness review once build timeline is confirmed.
- Track research/validation todos and close them before sprint kick-off.
