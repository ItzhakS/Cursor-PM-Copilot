## Trigger Conditions
- Customer complaints or escalated pain points indicate friction in value delivery.
- Signals suggest shifting satisfaction, retention, or adoption trends.
- Insights from conferences, advisors, or field conversations point to demand or gaps.
- Exploring expansion into adjacent markets/products.
- Preparing for investor conversations requiring crisp PMF evidence.

## Diagnostic Questions
- Who are the highest-value users and what pains are we solving decisively?
- What recent churn, downgrade, or stalled onboarding cases require root-cause analysis?
- Are usage, outcomes, and ROI narratives improving or degrading?
- Which hypotheses about new segments need validation?

## Research & Data Requirements
- Quant: activation funnels, feature usage, reliability metrics, ARR progress.
- Qual: customer interviews (CX team), support escalations, win/loss notes.
- Competitive/market insights (sales team, CEO field intel).
- Financial/data dashboards from data team (reliability, user snapshots, benchmarking).

## Synthesis Pattern
1. Aggregate quantitative indicators (trend charts, ratios, cohorts).
2. Layer qualitative insights to explain patterns; identify core jobs-to-be-done.
3. Map strengths, gaps, and opportunities by customer segment.
4. Formulate prioritized hypotheses/actions that reinforce PMF.

## Decision Gates
- Decide whether to double down, iterate, or pivot per segment.
- Confirm resource alignment (engineering, data, CX) for chosen actions.
- Communicate PMF status to leadership and fundraising stakeholders.

## Risks & Watchouts
- Over-indexing on anecdotal feedback without data triangulation.
- Ignoring reliability or delivery speed signals that undermine PMF.
- Delayed follow-up on action items, leaving engineering or CX waiting.

## Deliverables
- PMF summary (1-pager or slide) with current status, leading indicators, priority actions.
- Updated roadmap or experiment backlog reflecting decisions.
- Logged insights stored in `@Initiative level context` for future reference.
