## Trigger Conditions
- Need to investigate customer pains, workflows, or objections.
- Validating assumptions for new product areas or feature expansions.
- Seeking evidence to prioritize roadmap decisions or GTM experiments.

## Discovery Questions
- What outcome are we trying to enable or improve?
- Which customer personas do we need to hear from (admins, end users, billing, operations)?
- What hypotheses are we testing, and what would falsify them?
- How will we use the insights (PRD input, PMF update, GTM motion)?

## Research Methods & Tooling
- Customer interviews led with CX team; capture structured notes.
- Shadowing or workflow audits via analytics dashboards or session recordings.
- Surveys/polls for broader signal collection (coordinate with leadership or operations as needed).
- Deep, directed web research (industry reports, regulatory updates, competitor artifacts).
- Competitive/market review leveraging sales field insights and conference intel.

## Workflow
1. Define scope, hypotheses, and success criteria.
2. Recruit participants (coordinate with CX/sales/operations).
3. Prepare discussion guide or data query plan.
4. Conduct research, capture findings in shared template (store under relevant initiative).
5. Synthesize into themes, implications, and recommended next steps.

## Insight Capture
- Use standardized template: context, key quotes/data, implications, open questions.
- Tag follow-ups by owner (engineering, CX, data, GTM) with due dates.
- Update Action_Playbooks index when new reusable assets are produced.

## Communication Cadence
- Share preliminary findings in daily standups or dev sync if urgent.
- Present synthesized insights in weekly strategy/planning sessions as relevant.
- Log final summary in initiative folder; notify stakeholders via preferred channels (Slack/Notion).
