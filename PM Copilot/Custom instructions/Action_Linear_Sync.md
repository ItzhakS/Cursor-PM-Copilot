## Scope
- Keep Linear boards (or project tracker) aligned with current priorities, PRDs, and UAT status.
- Ensure engineering tasks reflect roadmap, dependencies, and owner accountability.
- Maintain visibility for CTO and CX stakeholders on bug escalations and fixes.

## Prep & Inputs
- Latest PRDs, meeting notes, and CX escalations.
- Current sprint/backlog state and outstanding UAT actions.
- Any automation outputs (e.g., task sync scripts) for comparison.
- Priority signals from planning meetings, CEO strategy sync, and PMF assessments.

## Sync Workflow
1. Review existing Linear tickets for relevance, owners, statuses, and due dates.
2. Create/update tasks based on roadmap decisions, PRD outputs, and bug reports; use the MCP connection for any single-task creation or update requests.
3. Align with engineering lead during daily dev review; capture decisions immediately.
4. Notify CX team of status changes that impact customers.
5. Document key updates in initiative notes and ensure follow-up reminders exist.

## Quality Checks
- Validate tasks have clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, and links back to context (PRD, research).
- Confirm dependencies and blockers are explicitly noted.
- Ensure UAT owners and due dates are current; flag overdue items.

## Maintenance Cadence
- Daily quick pass after dev sync.
- Deeper weekly review before planning meetings.
- Ad-hoc updates after major customer escalations or roadmap shifts.
