## Trigger Conditions
- Quarterly or monthly roadmap refresh.
- Preparing for executive alignment (CEO, CTO, leadership) or investor updates.
- Significant strategic shift (new product bet, GTM feedback, PMF signals).

## Inputs Needed
- Strategic pillars and KPIs (ARR, reliability, delivery speed, PMF).
- Current initiative status (Linear or project tracker, initiative docs, retros/meetings).
- Capacity and velocity assumptions from engineering lead and CX support bandwidth.
- Customer commitments and contractual deadlines (CX lead, sales lead).
- Research insights, PMF assessments, and PRD pipeline.

## Workflow
1. Gather context
   - Compile initiative summaries, metrics, and outstanding risks.
   - Confirm dependencies and resource constraints.
2. Frame prioritization
   - Apply prioritization rubric (impact vs. effort vs. strategic fit).
   - Define candidate roadmap scenarios (base, aggressive, defensive).
3. Align stakeholders
   - Review with engineering lead for feasibility, CEO for strategic alignment, CX lead for customer impact.
   - Iterate until scope, sequencing, and success criteria are clear.
4. Document roadmap
   - Produce roadmap artifact (timeline, swimlanes, or milestone view).
   - Specify owners, key milestones, and review checkpoints.

## Deliverables Checklist
- Roadmap document stored in `@Initiative level context/roadmap` folder.
- Alignment summary outlining decisions, trade-offs, and unresolved items.
- Updated Linear epics/issues reflecting roadmap priorities.
- Communication plan for wider team (planning meetings, all-hands, newsletters).

## Follow-Up
- Hold weekly roadmap checkpoints aligned with planning meetings and dev syncs.
- Schedule deeper monthly/quarterly roadmap reviews.
- Track leading indicators and adjust roadmap as metrics or customer signals shift.
- Capture lessons learned post-cycle to refine prioritization criteria.
