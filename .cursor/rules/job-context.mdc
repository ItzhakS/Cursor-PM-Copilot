## Role Snapshot
- Chief Product Officer responsible for shaping and prioritizing development work, ensuring timely high-quality delivery, and preserving product-market fit for Triage while incubating new product bets (e.g., Turbo Auth, reimbursement automation).
- Acts as coach and strategic partner to align product, engineering, and go-to-market execution with Exponential’s growth targets.
- Serves as connective tissue across product, delivery, customer experience, and data teams; escalates risks promptly and drives follow-through.

## Company Overview
- Exponential (exponentialcare.ai) empowers Post-Acute Care (PAC) teams—skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and home health agencies (HHAs)—to review referrals, select the right patients, and fill beds faster through AI-assisted workflows.
- Current product line: `Triage` (live) with adjacent initiatives under exploration: `Turbo Auth` (prior authorization automation) and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement automation.
- Strategic narrative: “Triage makes PACs more profitable—empower your team with cutting-edge AI. Review referrals, choose the right patients, and fill beds faster.”

## Org Map & Key Stakeholders
- `Adam Moisa — CTO`: Deeply technical founding engineer. Prefers minimal challenge to his technical decisions but welcomes genuine curiosity; requires persistent follow-up for responses and meeting attendance. Daily dev review with him anchors execution sync.
- `Shmuel (Sam) Eisenberg — Head of CX/CS`: Secondary founder, highly responsive and reliable, co-owns customer onboarding and profitability partnership. Leads thrice-weekly CX standups (joined by CPO) and assists with UAT.
- `Joel Posluszny — Deputy Head of CS`: Tech-savvy, manages customer escalations alongside Sam; attends daily CX standups; responsive but needs structured follow-up to ensure reliability.
- `Yoni Schwartz — Head of Data Science`: Expert in data/insurance projects (e.g., Best In Class document, reliability dashboard, user snapshot dashboard). Weekly sync; generally responsive though reminders help keep priorities on track; available for UAT support when prompted.
- `Daniel Schoenbrun — CEO`: Business founder focused on fundraising and vision. Weekly 1:1 dedicated to strategy; feedback-oriented and reliable yet can be verbose. Hard to reach via chat—phone works when urgent.
- `Roey Herzfeld — CFO`: Oversees contracts, finance, and assists with fundraising; limited day-to-day interaction.
- `Mordechai Glatter — Chief of Staff`: Partner on hiring and compliance (SOC2/HIPAA); responsive, reliable, early-career.
- `Chen Yakar — Head of Sales`: Weekly sync scheduled to gather field intel though attendance is inconsistent; responsiveness is low.
- `Yitzi (Isaac) Stark — Sales Rep`: Minimal direct interaction currently.
- `Karl Bernat — EA`: Supports CEO office; available to broader team.
- `Jasmine Lalanto — EA (Sales)`: Assists with newsletter design and related tasks.

## Strategic Pillars & KPIs
- `Revenue`: Achieve ≥ $500K ARR to unlock venture funding pathways.
- `GTM & Scale`: Accelerate onboarding and activation of live, paying customers.
- `Reliability`: Improve application stability with focus on aggregation success/failure ratios and messaging reliability.
- `Delivery Speed`: Shorten cycle time from prioritization to shipped functionality, including UAT throughput.
- `Product-Market Fit`: Maintain strong PMF for Triage while validating new product opportunities (Turbo Auth, reimbursement tooling).

## Operating Rhythm
- `Daily`: 1:1 dev task review with CTO Adam; daily CX standup (Sam, Joel, team) to monitor issues and customer escalations.
- `Weekly`: CPO–CEO strategy 1:1 (Daniel); CPO–Head of Data sync (Yoni); scheduled but inconsistently attended Sales sync (Chen); ongoing hiring/compliance touchpoints with Chief of Staff (Mordechai).
- `Weekly All-Hands`: Monday “EVOs Planning” for metrics review and weekly Extremely Valuable Objectives; Thursday “Celebrate the Wins” for EVO status (R/Y/G) and broader recognition.
- `Cadence Influence`: Continue shaping executive/product reviews, investor updates, and cross-functional sessions to reinforce the above pillars.

## Coaching Expectations
- `Engagement Style`: Socratic-first—ask concise clarifying questions that sharpen thinking before proposing solutions.
- `Communication`: Be direct, brief, and purposeful; avoid long-form exposition unless explicitly requested.
- `Challenge & Support`: When challenging assumptions, provide a concrete, concise rationale plus an actionable next step or alternative.
- `Context Discipline`: Confirm understanding of situation before answering; request missing context as needed.
- `Accountability`: Proactively flag when tasks depend on CPO follow-up to prevent bottlenecks.
