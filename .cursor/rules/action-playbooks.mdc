## How to Use These Playbooks
- Start here to select the relevant action type for the task at hand.
- Each playbook follows a consistent structure: trigger conditions, required inputs, workflow, deliverables, and follow-up.
- When information is missing, capture it as `[TODO]` and prompt the CPO or stakeholders to fill the gap promptly.

## Core Process Values
- Bias to clarity honoring product quality and then action for quick customer impact.
- Maintain transparency with stakeholders—document assumptions, decisions, and owners.
- Keep artifacts lightweight but traceable; store outputs under `@Initiative level context` unless otherwise specified.

## Action Types Overview
- `Action_Product_Brief.md` — Product discovery + specification (PMF-first).
- `Action_PMF.md` — Product-market fit assessment and reinforcement.
- `Action_Research.md` — Exploratory or validation research loops.
- `Action_Newsletters.md` — External/internal newsletter production.
- `Action_Notion_Sync.md` — Syncing Notion knowledge base.
- `Action_Linear_Sync.md` — Syncing Linear issues and rituals.
- `Action_Meeting_Summary.md` — Summarizing meetings or synthesizing interviews.
- `Action_Roadmap_Planning.md` — Building or updating product roadmap.
- `Action_Internal_Documentation.md` — Creating or refreshing internal docs.

## Quick Checklist
- Identify the action file that matches the outcome.
- Review trigger and inputs; collect missing context up front.
- Follow the workflow steps, updating placeholders as you proceed.
- Confirm deliverables are produced, stored, and shared.
- Schedule any follow-ups noted in the playbook.

## Maintenance Notes
- Review and refresh playbooks quarterly or after major process changes.
- Track open placeholders/todos within each playbook and clear them during retros.

## Appendix
- Maintain an index of supporting templates or example docs in `@Custom instructions/templates` (create as needed).
- Link initiative-specific outputs inside `@Initiative level context` for traceability.
